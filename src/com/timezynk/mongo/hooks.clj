(defmacro with-hooks
  "Insert hooks for converting documents. The <read-fn> function will be called for each document
   returned from MongoDB; the <write-fn> will be called for each document sent to MongoDB, both
   for the query and for the payload.

   The hook is applied recursively to nested documents.
   
   | Parameter | Description
   | ---       | ---
   | `:read`   | `optional fn` Called when returning a document from MongoDB.
   | `:write`  | `optional fn` Called for a query or payload to MongoDB.
   | `body`    | Encapsulated program calling the database.
   
   **Examples**
   
   ```clojure
   ; When a document is written to the database, replace the field 'name' with 'username':

     (insert! :coll {:name \"My Name\"}))
   ```"
